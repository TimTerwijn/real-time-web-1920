### Week1:
As you can see in the Week1 branch, I have been building an application to test if it was possible for me to make a simple game. During this project I was trying to broadcast the X coordinate with the other user. I also tried to register and login a user with the use of local storage and a unique string id.  

### Description
I want to make a space invader versus game for two players. 

### Install guide
* Clone or download the repository $ git clone https://github.com/TimTerwijn/real-time-web-1920.git
* Open server folder with VSCode.
* Open terminal en enter npm install.
* Enter npm start in terminal.
* Go to http://localhost:3000/ to use the app.

### How to use
* Create a user name.
* Write something to chat with the other users.
* Use the arrow keys to move the input field.
* If you write something now the text in the chat is also on this position for everyone.
