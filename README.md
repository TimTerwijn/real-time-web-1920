### Description
I build this application to test if it is possible for me to make a simple game. For the main exercise I want to make a space invader versus game for two players. This project I tried if it is possible to share the X coordinate with someone else. I have also tried to register and login a user with the use of local storage and a unique string id.

### Install guide
#### Requirements
* Clone or download the repository $ git clone https://github.com/TimTerwijn/real-time-web-1920.git
* Open server folder with VSCode.
* Open terminal en enter npm install.
* Enter npm start in terminal.
* Go to http://localhost:3000/ to use the app.

### How to use
* Create a user name.
* Write something to chat with the other users.
* Use the arrow keys to move the input field.
* If you write something now the text in the chat is also on this position for everyone.
